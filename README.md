This project involves creating a web application that manages coin denominations and calculates their total value. The application is structured around a Node.js environment using Fastify for the backend server.

really the first time that we worked on the actual back end code of a basic url webpage. Used the coin and node.js to test code for the first time. Became a big fan of node.js because of how easy it made running code. allowing for faster iterations and checking. 
also the first time I used the different URLs to test our coinbase program (/coin).
